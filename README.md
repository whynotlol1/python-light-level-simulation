# python-light-level-simulation
oversimplified light level simulation. 

you can mowe the light source using arrow buttons and increase or decrease it's power with [+] or [-] buttons

if you fix the optimisation (which is awful), you can use it for your games (the code can easily be translated to [java](https://github.com/whynotlol1/java-light-level-simulation/tree/main) or c++)

### requires python 3.10 or older to run
